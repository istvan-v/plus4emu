Changes in version 1.2.6
------------------------

  * implemented IEC level floppy drive emulation; this allows access to
    a directory on the PC filesystem, and supports reading and writing
    .prg, .p00, .s00, .u00, and .r00 files, and some commonly used CBM
    DOS commands
  * the debugger window now displays the current state of TED registers
  * on Windows and MacOS X the native file selection dialog is used
    instead of the FLTK one; also, the last PRG and screenshot file
    selected is remembered by the dialogs
  * various improvements have been made to the utilities
  * changed the TED luminance table to (hopefully) match the colors of
    the real machine more accurately
  * D64 files with any number of tracks from 35 to 42 are supported
  * new/improved GUI keyboard shortcuts
  * the old file I/O hack has been removed, since its functionality is
    now replaced by the IEC level drive emulation
  * added Gtk+ GUI theme (enabled with '-colorscheme 3' command line
    option)
  * some minor bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.5.2
--------------------------

  * fixed some minor TED emulation bugs

Changes in version 1.2.5.1
--------------------------

  * the full speed mode (Alt+W) now restores the original speed setting
    when turned off
  * added a "go to program counter" button to the disassembler in the
    debugger
  * some new utilities have been added
  * a few minor bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.5
------------------------

  * implemented Lua scripting in the debugger; this makes it possible to
    write complex rules for breakpoints, but can have other uses as
    well, since the script can read and write memory and CPU registers,
    in addition to having access to the standard Lua library functions
  * changed the debugger window layout so that there is a larger window
    with only two tabs
  * the disassembly view in the debugger now allows for paging backward,
    and the disassembly and memory dump displays can also be scrolled
    with the mouse wheel
  * made the serial bus delay for the 1541 high timing accuracy mode
    adjustable; while the default setting works with all the disk turbos
    tested so far, this option may be useful for debugging purposes
  * when using audio files as tape images, the signal read or written
    can optionally be inverted for compatibility with other software
  * the enabling of 6551 ACIA emulation is now configurable, rather than
    being fixed to machine configurations with 64K or more RAM
  * SID emulation and floppy drives with no disk image attached can be
    disabled from the GUI menu to reduce CPU usage; previously, these
    automatically enabled features could only be turned off by a forced
    or hard reset
  * added new GUI menu items for resetting floppy drives
  * new command line option (-tape) for loading tape images on startup;
    it has also been made possible to automatically load a file with
    .prg, .p00, .d64, .d81, or .tap extension by using the file name as
    a single command line argument
  * minor bug fixes and optimizations

Changes in version 1.2.4
------------------------

  * implemented the 6551 ACIA registers at $FD00-$FD0F, which are
    automatically enabled for configurations with 64K or more RAM; this
    is not complete yet, but the basic functionality works
  * video recording can also be done in RLE8 format now, which allows
    smaller file sizes than uncompressed YV12, at the expense of some TV
    emulation effects not being captured
  * added new command line option for selecting the GUI style and colors
  * various minor improvements and bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.3
------------------------

  * video and sound output can be recorded to AVI files
  * more accurate colors in NTSC mode
  * TED sound emulation improvements
  * added hue shift to the display configuration options
  * minor optimizations in serial floppy drive and printer emulation
  * the drive head position is now also shown on the LED display when
    it is changing
  * a few bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.2
------------------------

  * implemented Digi-Blaster emulation
  * added limited support for error information in D64 files
  * new option for setting SID model (6581 or 8580) to be emulated
  * P00 format files can be loaded
  * emulation speed percentage is now displayed on the title bar; it is
    also possible to set half, double, etc. speed in the menu
  * the head position (track, side, and sector) of all floppy drives
    can be displayed in a window

Changes in version 1.2.1
------------------------

  * TED emulation improvements; also fixed a bug introduced in version
    1.1.1
  * the frame rate in full speed mode is now limited to a maximum of
    50 Hz to improve performance
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.0
------------------------

  * many improvements in the TV emulation; to enable all the new
    features, use OpenGL mode and set the display quality to 3 (requires
    OpenGL 2.0 or newer and shader support)
  * added a tedmon-like monitor to the debugger; it supports all the
    commands, including assemble, but there are also some improvements
    and additional features (use ? to print the list of commands, or ? N
    for help on command N)
  * it is now possible to set breakpoints on TED video positions in the
    debugger
  * trace command in the monitor for logging CPU instructions to a text
    file; when debugging the main CPU, the TED video position at the
    first cycle of each opcode is also logged
  * light pen emulation
  * hardware level 1526/MPS-802 printer emulation
  * the file I/O ROM module now also includes a tape turbo; to enable
    it, set $0647 to $17, $27, $37, or $47 to select speed (from slowest
    to fastest), and use device 7 when saving
  * tape playback and recording can be sent to the sound output
  * the RAM startup pattern has been made configurable
  * minor TED emulation improvements
  * various bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.3
------------------------

  * fixed bug in Hannes memory expansion emulation
  * improved 6523 emulation in 1551 floppy drives
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.2
------------------------

  * fixed bug that caused the tape input signal to get stuck at high
    level sometimes even after stopping or closing the tape
  * optimized 1541 high timing accuracy mode
  * adjusted reSID filter for different clock frequency in Plus/4

Changes in version 1.1.1
------------------------

  * added new 1541 timing code that fixes some programs that previously
    did not load, at the expense of higher CPU usage; it is enabled by
    default, and can be turned on/off in the floppy configuration dialog
  * more accurate emulation of television vertical synchronization
  * MacOS X build fixes; also added patch for FLTK 1.1.7 which fixes the
    check callback on OS X
  * improvements and fixes in TED video shift register emulation
  * fixed CPU I/O port data direction register ($0000)
  * the ROM package now includes the 1541 DOS, rather than the 1541-II,
    as the latter breaks some demos; the 1541-II can still be used by
    loading dos15412.rom to ROM segment 10 in the machine configuration
  * minor optimizations

Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

  * implemented 1551 drive emulation
  * added floppy drive LED display to the GUI (1541 is red, 1551 is
    green, and 1581 is yellow)
  * the debugger now allows for debugging floppy drives; the drives are
    also mapped to the physical address range $180000-$1BFFFF
  * fixed 1541 disk change detection
  * keyboard map can be configured with the GUI
  * external game devices like joysticks and gamepads are supported, and
    can be assigned in the keyboard map like normal keys
  * the 'step over' button in the debugger now also skips branch
    instructions
  * invalid opcodes that normally jam the CPU can be used as breakpoints
    (with the priority assumed to be 3) that open the debugger, and the
    execution of the program can continue as if there was a NOP
    instruction
  * added new command line options for loading disk image, snapshot, and
    demo files on start-up; on Windows, D64 and D81 files are also
    optionally associated with the emulator
  * it is now possible to use WAV, AIFF, and other sound file formats as
    tape images; these files can be read and written, however, new files
    are created in plus4emu format
  * blank video output is generated when the TED is disabled by setting
    bit 5 of $FF07
  * reduced horizontal texture resolution to 384 in OpenGL mode when the
    quality is set to 0, for improved performance
  * minor GUI improvements and fixes
