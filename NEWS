Changes in version 1.2.2
------------------------

  * added limited support for error information in D64 files
  * P00 format files can be loaded

Changes in version 1.2.1
------------------------

  * TED emulation improvements; also fixed a bug introduced in version
    1.1.1
  * the frame rate in full speed mode is now limited to a maximum of
    50 Hz to improve performance
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.0
------------------------

  * many improvements in the TV emulation; to enable all the new
    features, use OpenGL mode and set the display quality to 3 (requires
    OpenGL 2.0 or newer and shader support)
  * added a tedmon-like monitor to the debugger; it supports all the
    commands, including assemble, but there are also some improvements
    and additional features (use ? to print the list of commands, or ? N
    for help on command N)
  * it is now possible to set breakpoints on TED video positions in the
    debugger
  * trace command in the monitor for logging CPU instructions to a text
    file; when debugging the main CPU, the TED video position at the
    first cycle of each opcode is also logged
  * light pen emulation
  * hardware level 1526/MPS-802 printer emulation
  * the file I/O ROM module now also includes a tape turbo; to enable
    it, set $0647 to $17, $27, $37, or $47 to select speed (from slowest
    to fastest), and use device 7 when saving
  * tape playback and recording can be sent to the sound output
  * the RAM startup pattern has been made configurable
  * minor TED emulation improvements
  * various bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.3
------------------------

  * fixed bug in Hannes memory expansion emulation
  * improved 6523 emulation in 1551 floppy drives
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.2
------------------------

  * fixed bug that caused the tape input signal to get stuck at high
    level sometimes even after stopping or closing the tape
  * optimized 1541 high timing accuracy mode
  * adjusted reSID filter for different clock frequency in Plus/4

Changes in version 1.1.1
------------------------

  * added new 1541 timing code that fixes some programs that previously
    did not load, at the expense of higher CPU usage; it is enabled by
    default, and can be turned on/off in the floppy configuration dialog
  * more accurate emulation of television vertical synchronization
  * MacOS X build fixes; also added patch for FLTK 1.1.7 which fixes the
    check callback on OS X
  * improvements and fixes in TED video shift register emulation
  * fixed CPU I/O port data direction register ($0000)
  * the ROM package now includes the 1541 DOS, rather than the 1541-II,
    as the latter breaks some demos; the 1541-II can still be used by
    loading dos15412.rom to ROM segment 10 in the machine configuration
  * minor optimizations

Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

  * implemented 1551 drive emulation
  * added floppy drive LED display to the GUI (1541 is red, 1551 is
    green, and 1581 is yellow)
  * the debugger now allows for debugging floppy drives; the drives are
    also mapped to the physical address range $180000-$1BFFFF
  * fixed 1541 disk change detection
  * keyboard map can be configured with the GUI
  * external game devices like joysticks and gamepads are supported, and
    can be assigned in the keyboard map like normal keys
  * the 'step over' button in the debugger now also skips branch
    instructions
  * invalid opcodes that normally jam the CPU can be used as breakpoints
    (with the priority assumed to be 3) that open the debugger, and the
    execution of the program can continue as if there was a NOP
    instruction
  * added new command line options for loading disk image, snapshot, and
    demo files on start-up; on Windows, D64 and D81 files are also
    optionally associated with the emulator
  * it is now possible to use WAV, AIFF, and other sound file formats as
    tape images; these files can be read and written, however, new files
    are created in plus4emu format
  * blank video output is generated when the TED is disabled by setting
    bit 5 of $FF07
  * reduced horizontal texture resolution to 384 in OpenGL mode when the
    quality is set to 0, for improved performance
  * minor GUI improvements and fixes
